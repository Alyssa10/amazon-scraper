"Complete disappointment","Why did you guys put a mute toggle on the “mic to controller” cable instead of a volume control? I didn’t know about this and in order to change my volume I have to open up freaking settings and adjust chat and game volume inside the Xbox itself. I get it, they want us to by the mic amp...

"Even better than the 2017 a40 tr","Absolutely love the A40 model. 2017 model felt a little big, adjusters held great though so no problem. These are even more sturdy and fit perfectly. Only problem I have with these is for some reason the inline mute cable does not include the volume slider like the previous gen I had. Tried the new gen 4 A50’s before this, the surround sound feature makes a good echo or metallic echo of your voice. If you try the normal sound mode, sounds just like the A40’s minus the extra $150! The 2019 a40’s also comes with the 2 year activation code for Dolby digital. I’m uncertain if I can tell the difference because without it it still sounds really good. In a way, the volume sounds more “full” in the earpiece if you will, I guess that’s a given since it is supposed to be surround sound with Dolby digital on through Xbox settings. All in all 4 of 5 stars, if this included the volume slider on the inline cable it’d be perfect. It really is a shame it doesn’t include that. Edit: So after getting back in town and using them more, the top band cushion could be a little bit wider as in front to back. Not noticeable most of the time, some days my scalp is more sensitive than others and when it is it feels like the cushion is narrow and feels like a bar on my head. Still 4 of 5 stars though because a simple adjustment fixes it.","18 Aug 2019","Platform For Display: Xbox Series X|S / Xbox One Edition: A40 TR","","Yes","Ryan","4.0","ASTRO Gaming A40 TR Wired Headset with Astro Audio V2 for Xbox Series X | S, Xbox One, PC & Mac","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NSN41YB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1

"Pricey but work great","I've owned a pair of a40's for a couple of years now (my first pair died after about 2 years of frequent use and the mic just decided to stop working). This will be my second pair. They work great for Call of Duty games because of the surround sound and clarity of sound. I'd recommend these if you don't mind the price tag of $100+. One thing I'll say as a side note is that the first time I bought a pair of these, I bought it along with the Mixamp, which I don't think is a necessary item at all. In fact, I never could figure out what the point of the mixamp even was because whether I plugged it in directly through the controller without the mixamp, or if I did connect through optical cable and mixamp, it produced the same sound quality and volume level for me, and so I don't think you really need one. Someone else might have a different take on this, so you might want to research it further, but that's what I'd say about the mixamp.","12 Jan 2021","Platform For Display: Xbox Series X|S / Xbox One Edition: A40 TR","","Yes","TPM985","5.0","ASTRO Gaming A40 TR Wired Headset with Astro Audio V2 for Xbox Series X | S, Xbox One, PC & Mac","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NSN41YB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1

"Don't listen to the negative reviews! This is a solid headset!","This headset is exponential! The sound is clear and the highs and base are well balanced. It also has great comfort for long usage. The customization is tops, with you being able to swap out the ear muffs with new ones if you feel the need to. You can also switch the mic to be on the left or right side, and you can switch the headband and tags on the earmuffs to customize the headset your way! This headset is MEANT TO LAST, as if you were to for some reason break the mic or the ear muffs were damaged or the cord was cut, you can go on Astros website and get brand new replacement parts so that the headset is good to go again! If you're looking for a mid-priced headset, go for this one, cause it's very reliable and a very excellent pick!","05 Jan 2021","Platform For Display: Xbox Series X|S / Xbox One Edition: A40 TR","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1F9pqcnL7S._SY88.jpg","Yes","clc251","5.0","ASTRO Gaming A40 TR Wired Headset with Astro Audio V2 for Xbox Series X | S, Xbox One, PC & Mac","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NSN41YB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1

"Good sound quality, amazing customization (with further cost), but it's a loose mess on your head.","I didn't use the detachable mic much, since I mostly play games on PC where I have a separate microphone.. but while I played Xbox the mic arm would always fall down and required constant readjusting. Can't comment on the audio quality of it, but I didn't have any complaints from friends. The ear cups swivel like crazy, and the head size adjusters got loose to the point of requiring zip ties to stay tight enough. Couple those problems with the fact that the pad on the headband is very narrow, the thing falls off my head if I lean back in my chair... The headset is fairly comfortable when it's staying in place, though. No pressure or heat. The pads are all sufficiently soft. I really wanted to like this headset, as it sounds good and I absolutely love the modular customization. I can have a waifu on each earpiece? Awesome. It also has that high quality mix amp, but I decided to pass on that until later (which turned out to be never). I heard in reviews that this brand is known for their unchallenged build quality, but apparently they aren't consistent. Final word from me is to buy at your own risk; my set might have been an uncommon defect or something. My friend has a slightly older model and he really likes them, so maybe look into those instead?","23 Jun 2020","Platform For Display: Xbox Series X|S / Xbox One Edition: A40 TR","","Yes","Joshua Flack","3.0","ASTRO Gaming A40 TR Wired Headset with Astro Audio V2 for Xbox Series X | S, Xbox One, PC & Mac","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NSN41YB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1

"It was buggy since I got it.","When it did work, one of the greatest sounding headsets. I just got them a couple of days ago. The headsets were constantly muting itself when I talked which became annoying since it was happening frequently. There is a mute switch on the mic but I never touched it. In order to ""unmute myself"", I had to disconnect and reconnect both ends of the cable multiple times before it started working again. Also, if you are one of those people who moves your controller a good amount, I do not recommend these. I noticed on the second day, the sound would be cut off on one ear or one side was louder than the other. I heard great things about this brand. Sadly my experience didn't meet those expectations, especially for the price. My previous headset lasted me 4 and a half years. It went through so much and was such a great headset, which cost about less than half the amount to the price of this one. Probably won't ever get a headset from Astros. I never had so many problems with a pair of headphones in such a short amount of time.","14 Mar 2020","Platform For Display: Xbox Series X|S / Xbox One Edition: A40 TR","","Yes","David Soto","1.0","ASTRO Gaming A40 TR Wired Headset with Astro Audio V2 for Xbox Series X | S, Xbox One, PC & Mac","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NSN41YB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1

"Good sound quality, amazing customization (with further cost), but it's a loose mess on your head.","I didn't use the detachable mic much, since I mostly play games on PC where I have a separate microphone.. but while I played Xbox the mic arm would always fall down and required constant readjusting. Can't comment on the audio quality of it, but I didn't have any complaints from friends. The ear cups swivel like crazy, and the head size adjusters got loose to the point of requiring zip ties to stay tight enough. Couple those problems with the fact that the pad on the headband is very narrow, the thing falls off my head if I lean back in my chair... The headset is fairly comfortable when it's staying in place, though. No pressure or heat. The pads are all sufficiently soft. I really wanted to like this headset, as it sounds good and I absolutely love the modular customization. I can have a waifu on each earpiece? Awesome. It also has that high quality mix amp, but I decided to pass on that until later (which turned out to be never).

"It was buggy since I got it.","When it did work, one of the greatest sounding headsets. I just got them a couple of days ago. The headsets were constantly muting itself when I talked which became annoying since it was happening frequently. There is a mute switch on the mic but I never touched it.

Also, if you are one of those people who moves your controller a good amount, I do not recommend these.

"Even better than the 2017 a40 tr","Absolutely love the A40 model. 2017 model felt a little big, adjusters held great though so no problem. These are even more sturdy and fit perfectly. Only problem I have with these is for some reason the inline mute cable does not include the volume slider like the previous gen I had. Tried the new gen 4 A50’s before this, the surround sound feature makes a good echo or metallic echo of your voice. If you try the normal sound mode, sounds just like the A40’s minus the extra $150! The 2019 a40’s also comes with the 2 year activation code for Dolby digital. I’m uncertain if I can tell the difference because without it it still sounds really good. In a way, the volume sounds more “full” in the earpiece if you will, I guess that’s a given since it is supposed to be surround sound with Dolby digital on through Xbox settings. All in all 4 of 5 stars, if this included the volume slider on the inline cable it’d be perfect. It really is a shame it doesn’t include that. Edit: So after getting back in town and using them more, the top band cushion could be a little bit wider as in front to back. Not noticeable most of the time, some days my scalp is more sensitive than others and when it is it feels like the cushion is narrow and feels like a bar on my head. Still 4 of 5 stars though because a simple adjustment fixes it.","18 Aug 2019","Platform For Display: Xbox Series X|S / Xbox One Edition: A40 TR","","Yes","Ryan","4.0","ASTRO Gaming A40 TR Wired Headset with Astro Audio V2 for Xbox Series X | S, Xbox One, PC & Mac","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NSN41YB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=4

"Pricey but work great","I've owned a pair of a40's for a couple of years now (my first pair died after about 2 years of frequent use and the mic just decided to stop working). This will be my second pair. They work great for Call of Duty games because of the surround sound and clarity of sound. I'd recommend these if you don't mind the price tag of $100+. One thing I'll say as a side note is that the first time I bought a pair of these, I bought it along with the Mixamp, which I don't think is a necessary item at all. In fact, I never could figure out what the point of the mixamp even was because whether I plugged it in directly through the controller without the mixamp, or if I did connect through optical cable and mixamp, it produced the same sound quality and volume level for me, and so I don't think you really need one.

"Even better than the 2017 a40 tr","Absolutely love the A40 model. 2017 model felt a little big, adjusters held great though so no problem. These are even more sturdy and fit perfectly. Only problem I have with these is for some reason the inline mute cable does not include the volume slider like the previous gen I had. Tried the new gen 4 A50’s before this, the surround sound feature makes a good echo or metallic echo of your voice. If you try the normal sound mode, sounds just like the A40’s minus the extra $150! The 2019 a40’s also comes with the 2 year activation code for Dolby digital. I’m uncertain if I can tell the difference because without it it still sounds really good. In a way, the volume sounds more “full” in the earpiece if you will, I guess that’s a given since it is supposed to be surround sound with Dolby digital on through Xbox settings. All in all 4 of 5 stars, if this included the volume slider on the inline cable it’d be perfect. It really is a shame it doesn’t include that. Edit: So after getting back in town and using them more, the top band cushion could be a little bit wider as in front to back. Not noticeable most of the time, some days my scalp is more sensitive than others and when it is it feels like the cushion is narrow and feels like a bar on my head.

"Pricey but work great","I've owned a pair of a40's for a couple of years now (my first pair died after about 2 years of frequent use and the mic just decided to stop working). This will be my second pair. They work great for Call of Duty games because of the surround sound and clarity of sound. I'd recommend these if you don't mind the price tag of $100+. One thing I'll say as a side note is that the first time I bought a pair of these, I bought it along with the Mixamp, which I don't think is a necessary item at all. In fact, I never could figure out what the point of the mixamp even was because whether I plugged it in directly through the controller without the mixamp, or if I did connect through optical cable and mixamp, it produced the same sound quality and volume level for me, and so I don't think you really need one. Someone else might have a different take on this, so you might want to research it further, but that's what I'd say about the mixamp.","12 Jan 2021","Platform For Display: Xbox Series X|S / Xbox One Edition: A40 TR","","Yes","TPM985","5.0","ASTRO Gaming A40 TR Wired Headset with Astro Audio V2 for Xbox Series X | S, Xbox One, PC & Mac","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NSN41YB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=6

You can also switch the mic to be on the left or right side, and you can switch the headband and tags on the earmuffs to customize the headset your way! This headset is MEANT TO LAST, as if you were to for some reason break the mic or the ear muffs were damaged or the cord was cut, you can go on Astros website and get brand new replacement parts so that the headset is good to go again!

"Good sound quality, amazing customization (with further cost), but it's a loose mess on your head.","I didn't use the detachable mic much, since I mostly play games on PC where I have a separate microphone.. but while I played Xbox the mic arm would always fall down and required constant readjusting. Can't comment on the audio quality of it, but I didn't have any complaints from friends. The ear cups swivel like crazy, and the head size adjusters got loose to the point of requiring zip ties to stay tight enough. Couple those problems with the fact that the pad on the headband is very narrow, the thing falls off my head if I lean back in my chair... The headset is fairly comfortable when it's staying in place, though. No pressure or heat. The pads are all sufficiently soft. I really wanted to like this headset, as it sounds good and I absolutely love the modular customization. I can have a waifu on each earpiece? Awesome. It also has that high quality mix amp, but I decided to pass on that until later (which turned out to be never). I heard in reviews that this brand is known for their unchallenged build quality, but apparently they aren't consistent. Final word from me is to buy at your own risk; my set might have been an uncommon defect or something.

"It was buggy since I got it.","When it did work, one of the greatest sounding headsets. I just got them a couple of days ago. The headsets were constantly muting itself when I talked which became annoying since it was happening frequently. There is a mute switch on the mic but I never touched it. In order to ""unmute myself"", I had to disconnect and reconnect both ends of the cable multiple times before it started working again. Also, if you are one of those people who moves your controller a good amount, I do not recommend these. I noticed on the second day, the sound would be cut off on one ear or one side was louder than the other. I heard great things about this brand. Sadly my experience didn't meet those expectations, especially for the price. My previous headset lasted me 4 and a half years. It went through so much and was such a great headset, which cost about less than half the amount to the price of this one. Probably won't ever get a headset from Astros.

"Pricey but work great","I've owned a pair of a40's for a couple of years now (my first pair died after about 2 years of frequent use and the mic just decided to stop working). This will be my second pair. They work great for Call of Duty games because of the surround sound and clarity of sound. I'd recommend these if you don't mind the price tag of $100+. One thing I'll say as a side note is that the first time I bought a pair of these, I bought it along with the Mixamp, which I don't think is a necessary item at all. In fact, I never could figure out what the point of the mixamp even was because whether I plugged it in directly through the controller without the mixamp, or if I did connect through optical cable and mixamp, it produced the same sound quality and volume level for me, and so I don't think you really need one. Someone else might have a different take on this, so you might want to research it further, but that's what I'd say about the mixamp.","12 Jan 2021","Platform For Display: Xbox Series X|S / Xbox One Edition: A40 TR","","Yes","TPM985","5.0","ASTRO Gaming A40 TR Wired Headset with Astro Audio V2 for Xbox Series X | S, Xbox One, PC & Mac","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NSN41YB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=8

"Good sound quality, amazing customization (with further cost), but it's a loose mess on your head.","I didn't use the detachable mic much, since I mostly play games on PC where I have a separate microphone.. but while I played Xbox the mic arm would always fall down and required constant readjusting. Can't comment on the audio quality of it, but I didn't have any complaints from friends. The ear cups swivel like crazy, and the head size adjusters got loose to the point of requiring zip ties to stay tight enough. Couple those problems with the fact that the pad on the headband is very narrow, the thing falls off my head if I lean back in my chair... The headset is fairly comfortable when it's staying in place, though. No pressure or heat. The pads are all sufficiently soft. I really wanted to like this headset, as it sounds good and I absolutely love the modular customization. I can have a waifu on each earpiece? Awesome. It also has that high quality mix amp, but I decided to pass on that until later (which turned out to be never).

"It was buggy since I got it.","When it did work, one of the greatest sounding headsets. I just got them a couple of days ago. The headsets were constantly muting itself when I talked which became annoying since it was happening frequently. There is a mute switch on the mic but I never touched it. In order to ""unmute myself"", I had to disconnect and reconnect both ends of the cable multiple times before it started working again. Also, if you are one of those people who moves your controller a good amount, I do not recommend these. I noticed on the second day, the sound would be cut off on one ear or one side was louder than the other. I heard great things about this brand. Sadly my experience didn't meet those expectations, especially for the price. My previous headset lasted me 4 and a half years. It went through so much and was such a great headset, which cost about less than half the amount to the price of this one. Probably won't ever get a headset from Astros.

I didn’t know about this and in order to change my volume I have to open up freaking settings and adjust chat and game volume inside the Xbox itself. I get it, they want us to by the mic amp...

This stuff is just unacceptable for a 150 dollar headset.

"Even better than the 2017 a40 tr","Absolutely love the A40 model. 2017 model felt a little big, adjusters held great though so no problem. These are even more sturdy and fit perfectly. Only problem I have with these is for some reason the inline mute cable does not include the volume slider like the previous gen I had. Tried the new gen 4 A50’s before this, the surround sound feature makes a good echo or metallic echo of your voice. If you try the normal sound mode, sounds just like the A40’s minus the extra $150! The 2019 a40’s also comes with the 2 year activation code for Dolby digital. I’m uncertain if I can tell the difference because without it it still sounds really good. In a way, the volume sounds more “full” in the earpiece if you will, I guess that’s a given since it is supposed to be surround sound with Dolby digital on through Xbox settings. All in all 4 of 5 stars, if this included the volume slider on the inline cable it’d be perfect. It really is a shame it doesn’t include that. Edit: So after getting back in town and using them more, the top band cushion could be a little bit wider as in front to back. Not noticeable most of the time, some days my scalp is more sensitive than others and when it is it feels like the cushion is narrow and feels like a bar on my head.

In order to ""unmute myself"", I had to disconnect and reconnect both ends of the cable multiple times before it started working again. Also, if you are one of those people who moves your controller a good amount, I do not recommend these. I noticed on the second day, the sound would be cut off on one ear or one side was louder than the other. I heard great things about this brand. Sadly my experience didn't meet those expectations, especially for the price. My previous headset lasted me 4 and a half years. It went through so much and was such a great headset, which cost about less than half the amount to the price of this one. Probably won't ever get a headset from Astros. I never had so many problems with a pair of headphones in such a short amount of time.","14 Mar 2020","Platform For Display: Xbox Series X|S / Xbox One Edition: A40 TR","","Yes","David Soto","1.0","ASTRO Gaming A40 TR Wired Headset with Astro Audio V2 for Xbox Series X | S, Xbox One, PC & Mac","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NSN41YB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=10

"Pending Return","Excited to finally have a decent headset, but my excitement was soon halted. After plugging in and attempting to try the headset out, I sound found that only the right  side was working and that I would have to move the auxiliary cord around in order for it to pick up a signal. I reached out for a replacement to see if I just had bad luck, but I see that others have had issues with theirs. I checked and these should be new and not refurbished. I would like a confirmation that these are new. I originally was going to go through the Astro gaming website, but their shipping would take longer and the headset was the same price.","28 Dec 2020","Platform For Display: Xbox Series X|S / Xbox One Edition: A40 TR","","Yes","Pedro","1.0","ASTRO Gaming A40 TR Wired Headset with Astro Audio V2 for Xbox Series X | S, Xbox One, PC & Mac","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NSN41YB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=10

"Excellent audio quality!","Bought this to replace a Steel Series Arctis 5 that I have had for a couple years. People I game with would often complain about an echo that we ultimately determined was caused by my old headset.  This one cured the problem and introduced me to a high quality audio experience that I did not know I could attain! I highly recommend this headset!","14 Dec 2020","Platform For Display: Xbox Series X|S / Xbox One Edition: A40 TR","","Yes","J.
